# Circuits
The wordpress theme for serious projects with high demands.

## Usage
This project is still in beta stage. For latest changes, see the dev branch.

## Goal
We want to make a theme that will match todays requirements.
The idea is to boilerplate as much startup code as possible and write code that really matters to the specifics of the project.
